# Contributing to CanvasLMS Kit

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CanvasLMS Kit. It's people like you that make CanvasLMS Kit such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [CanvasLMS Kit Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?
  
### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.
- **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch.
- **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a reduced test case.

Please provide a clear description of the issue, including steps to reproduce, and as much context as possible: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead?

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g., implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

**Adhere to the coding conventions** used throughout the project and include tests relevant to your contribution.

#### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Configure the necessary development tools on your machine (e.g., PHP, Composer).
3. Read the project's README for any specific setup instructions.

#### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).
2. Make your changes. Write and run tests.
3. Ensure your changes adhere to the existing coding standards.
4. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.

#### Submitting the Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork.
2. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the CanvasLMS Kit repository.
3. Provide a clear and detailed description of the pull request.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### PHP Styleguide

Follow the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards.

### Testing

- Include tests for new functionality.
- Ensure that your code does not break existing tests.
